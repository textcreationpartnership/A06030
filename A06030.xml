            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17817:13"/> For looke as one though hee were an Earle, and neuer ſo great and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, if hee be but guilty of treaſon againſt the King, is miſerable, notwithſtanding all his poſſeſſions and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo here had one all the world, if ſinne lye at his doore and be not pardoned, he is wretched.

That a childe is not bredde and manifeſtly brought foorth at once, the beginning of things vſually is in one time, the manifeſtation in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A man may haue the cauſe of a ſickneſſe twenty yeeres within him, without feeling himſelfe ſicke, or knowing one fit of ſicknes; So ſinne may be within one as a cauſe of all miſery, long before he finde himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ſenſibly miſerable: The reaſon whereof is double:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It vſeth to yeeld for the preſent a pleaſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17817:14"/> which breedeth inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paine in times after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Thus Good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, (as wee vſe to call them) neither feele, nor ſee any hurt in their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courſes, which pleaſe their palate for the preſent, but breed, though inſenſibly the painefull diſeaſes in which they end;<note n="*" place="margin">Luimus ſenes quae in inventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te peccaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy in youth ordinarily cauſing ſickneſſe in age. Thus men count it no hurt to runne into bookes, ſetting themſelues in debt, becauſe it eaſeth them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though it breake their backe in the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sinne is in a heart that loueth it, which makes it no whit grieuous. Things in their naturall place are not ponderous: A tankard of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17817:15"/> water is a mans load on land, but were he in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ſea, all the water in it would not preſſe, nor burthen him, for the waters there are in their proper place, and ſo borne vp that they are not weighty: Thus when but the remainders of ſinne are in a heart conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, they make it crie out,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24</note> 
                  <hi>O miſerable &amp;c.</hi> but let neuer ſo raigning a ſinne dwell in a heart vnregenerate it doth not ſeeme any whit grieuous; ſuch a heart is the naturall and proper ſeate of ſinne in which it reſteth. We ſee then, that ſinne is the principall cauſe of all miſery and ſo it is indeed; For pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments could not make a man miſerable but for ſinne: Suppoſe man had bin made

Now theſe once ſeazing on vs, we then beginne to bee apparantly wretched: When a man murthereth, or ſtealeth, and by that meanes becomes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17817:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſubiect to death, then hee is miſerable, for then is ſowne the ſeede of his future woe.

Thus though while men are conſcious of ſinne onely, their miſery is not ſeene; yet when Gods Iuſtice hath inflicted any part of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſo farre foorth their miſery is openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, and ſet forth to the view of all.</p>

               <p>Here are ſet downe two Conſiderations, by which, as by a glaſſe wee may ſee the fouleneſſe of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Firſt by the puniſhment; for proportionable to this in greatneſſe muſt the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence bee: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Iuſtice doth rule and meaſure the puniſhment by the offence; if that be little, the puniſhment that it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth is little, if that bee great, the puniſhment is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable. Now if a thing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17817:35"/> meaſured forth be long and wide, the meaſure muſt bee vnderſtood to be long and wide alſo. Hence it is that in humane puniſhments we ſee the greatneſſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; if one be reſtrained wee gather hee hath done ſome fault, if impriſoned, if hanged in chaines, or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſtill as the puniſhment increaſeth we coniecture the fault to haue been coreſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: How foule then muſt that offence haue beene, which the iuſt and moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God hath puniſhed with ſo many miſeries in this life, with death in the end, and after with eternall deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Againe, the fouleneſſe of ſinne is clearely diſcerned by conſidering the perſon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17817:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> againſt whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in any good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill worke, the perſon that doth it, or the circumſtance of perſon about whom it is done doth impart to the worke ſuch a reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it deſerueth accordingly. Let a common man come to me when I ſend, and a ſmall thing doth recompence his paines, but let a Doctour of Phiſicke come, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is his due: the qualitie of his perſon doth ſo digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his worke, and make it of anſwerable value.

Let a Subiect doe good to any, and it well deſerueth, but doing ſome ſpeciall ſeruice to his Prince he deſerueth greatly.

This doth follow on the former; for looke as a Creditor, when he is paide that which is owing to him, he then is at reſt, and hath that hee would haue; ſo when Chriſt our Surety, had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17817:71"/> paid as it were to Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that puniſhment of the Law, in which we ſtood indebted, Gods reuenging Iuſtice is at reſt, holding it ſelfe contented: If you doe one wrong, pay him that which may counteruaile the wrong, and hee is ſatisfied.

Looke as the body of him did die not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it remained perſonally vnited to God the Sonne: ſo the ſoule might ſuffer an impreſſion of his Fathers wrath which is a kinde of death to the ſoule, notwithſtanding the perſonall coiunction of it to God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the holineſſe of Chriſt no whit obſcured, he might ſuffer the full wrath of God, death; for it doth not ſtand in being (for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) ſinnefull properly, or in being depriued of faith and other graces, but in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſinne, a priuation of felicity, or at leaſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of that blisfull fauour, which is better then life, and in an impreſſion of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17817:78"/> wrath, which is as grieuous as death it ſelfe to the ſoule: Now this Chriſt felt, though he wanted no faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to cleaue to God; yet hee wanted the bleſſedneſſe which was to bee found in God; yea he felt that wrath againſt ſinne, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, ſinne whereof he was guilty <hi>in nobis, non in ſe,</hi> in vs, not in himſelfe. Looke as the ſoule may bee vnited with the body (as in ſleepe (and yet not worke in the body, ſo God vnited to Chriſt in ſoule, yet did forſake him, and for a time reſtraine that influence of fauour, in ſenſe wherof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth life ſpirituall: but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here rather familiar il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, then profound ſpeech of doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:17817:78"/>
               <p>His naturall death may be conſidered in his ſoule, which was ſeuered from his body, depriued of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſenſitiue, and operations which it had exerciſed in the body, or in his body which was now lying in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, in a ſtate ſubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, though it was preſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 2.31</note> from knowing actuall corruption: and in theſe was the vpſhot of all thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings Chriſt endured for vs. I haue nothing to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, it is a great miſtery beyond all compariſon; if any ſhadow may be vſed, thinke what ſome perſons in their deepeſt loue aduenture on, that they may be ioyned to ſome peereleſſe Virgins, they leaue their natiue Countries, commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

               <p>Secondly, He did obey God with his whole man, with his vnderſtanding, will, affections, as well as his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man: With what zeale of ſpirit did hee caſt thoſe Merchants out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.17.</note> For looke as a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full picture, which hath no ſpirit nor life in it, is but a

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was to the end. For he gaue vp the ghoſt, in loue to God and man, greater then the iuſtice of the Law could require: it is in obeying the Law, as in running a race; if

               <p>We haue deliuerance from ſinne, by all Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings after ſome ſort, but not alike; principally by thoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17817:86"/> before his death, and thoſe in which more properly his paſſion conſiſteth. Thoſe former ſufferings, as they taught Chriſt patience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally fitted him, to bee a compaſſionate high Prieſt, had in them example for our inſtruction; ſo were they acceſſory &amp; miniſtring to that further &amp; more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſatisfactory ſuffering of his death and paſſion. Looke as if an Engliſh-man were held priſoner in <hi>France,</hi> who could not bee releaſed, but on ſuch a ranſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the good will of the Gouernours obtained; ſay ſome of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would worke his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, he doth addreſſe himſelfe for <hi>France,</hi> he liueth there ſubmitting himſelfe to

               <p>Thus Chriſt, he tooke our nature, came from heauen, and dwelt amongſt vs in that tabernacle of fleſh, hee yeelded himſelfe ſubiect to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17817:87"/> our faſhions and lawes as it were, he did beare indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and iniuries, from the world who knew him not, he at length tendred, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory paſſion to God his Father for vs, and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his grace, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of all good things on vs. The ſuffering then of death, hath an eminencie aboue all other, in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſin and puniſhment from vs. Looke as it was in the ſhadow; the faithfull of the old Teſtament, they did as in a Sacrament receiue deliuerance from their ſinne, by the death of their ſinne-offering: ſo is it here with vs. Chriſt becomming our ſacrifice for ſinnes, taking them on him to beare them, and doe them away in our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17817:87"/> behalfe, his offering vp com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to quit vs from the guilt of them; No wonder, for if a ſuretie diſcharge a debt in our behalfe, we ſtand no longer bound to it; thus our Sauiour in his death, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the vtmoſt farthing, nay performing a ſuffering of infinit more dignity, then vindicatiue iuſtice could haue required; the grace of God doth ſet vs free moſt iuſtly; hence Chriſt is ſaid to haue cancelled,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hand-writing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, whether that of the Ceremoniall law, as it teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our guilt, or that inward teſtification of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17817:88"/> debt, which now they haue anſwered, and deface and cancell them, that naught may euer bee claimed by them: thus did our Sauiour, ſo that in his death, we may vſe that<note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> interrogatory of a good conſcience, and ſay,<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8.33, 34.</note> Who ſhall lay any thing to our charge, it is Chriſt that is dead &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To conſider this more particularly. Chriſts death doth free vs, firſt from the guilt of ſinne. Secondly, from the ſpot or power of it in vs. Thirdly, from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The guilt of ſinne is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie in it, binding vs to pay condigne puniſhment, to the iuſtice of God. This pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment therefore borne of Chriſt, and preſented by him
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17817:88"/> for vs, it cannot be but that our bond to beare it, ſhould be diſſolued, or that iuſtice might require againe, a thing already diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our blot of ſin, that life of the old Serpent, that liuing death of ſoules, is remoued. For Chriſts death muſt not be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely as an exemplarie cauſe, working mortification of ſin, or as a morall cauſe, by way of meditation, but as hauing force obtained by it, and iſſuing out of it, which doth by litle and litle abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſinne, euen the ſpirit which doth mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, both fruits and roots of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Looke as <hi>Adam</hi> dying a naturall death, did kill this naturall life in vs all, firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17817:89"/> it mortall, ſo as it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily muſt die, then at length cauſing death it ſelfe: ſo doth the death of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> worke the death of ſinne, firſt wounding it in vs with mortalitie, ſuch as will bring it certainely to death, then vtterly diſſoluing it in the end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Chriſts death doth free vs, from all other miſeries; for the cauſe which did breed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue theſe taken away, they muſt needs likewiſe bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. Take away the cauſe of a ſicknes, you make the painfull diſtempers which follow vpon it, ceaſe alſo. Diſcharge once the debt for him who lieth in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all with one worke, you free him from priſon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17817:89"/> and many other greeuances, to which by reaſon of his debt, he was held ſubiect.</p>

Now there are three bonds in the body myſtical, whereof Chriſt is the head and we members. The firſt is from Chriſt to vs, that is the bond of his Spirit. The ſecond runneth from vs to Chriſt, and that is our faith primarily, and conſequently
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17817:96"/> our whole heart and other affections. The third bond runneth from each member to other, that is Loue.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17817:97"/> that the King will ſhew him grace, before hee can vnite himſelfe with the King by loue, as one whom he hath found alway good and gracious vnto him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if you offer mee, and by promiſe aſſure me of any kindneſſe, I muſt firſt know what you ſay to mee, and perſwade my ſelfe you meane as you ſpeake, before I can loue you as my kinde friend; thus before wee can loue God, as gracious to vs, who are by nature children of his wrath, wee muſt by faith apprehend his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs; and before we can loue Chriſt, we muſt by faith vnite our ſelues with that grace of his, which he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowne in the word.</p>
               <p>Looke then as our bodily
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17817:97"/> members by nerues and ſnewes are knit with the head: ſo our faith is that prime and principall liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which we are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that firſt thing, whereby wee come to haue benefit by Chriſt, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe in that iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and life which come through him; wherefore let vs labour by faith to get our ſelues made one with Chriſt; If a thing bee neuer ſo good, what is that to vs, till we get ſome of it we are not the nearer: ſo though Chriſt be of neuer ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, if wee let him hang in the aire, &amp; prouide not that he dwell in our hearts, by faith, we ſhall be no whit the better for him.</p>

For this grace maketh only that firſt apprehenſion of CHRIST, through whom apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we are iuſtified and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though a man hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members in his body, yet hee hath but one by which hee vſeth to receiue any thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the hand, and ſo though our ſoules haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graces beſtowed on them, yet haue they but one hand of Faith, wherewith to receiue Chriſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits vnto ſaluation. But when we ſay that only Faith doth ſaue vs, we meane not that faith, which is alone without all other graces of loue, doth ſaue vs, but that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17817:98"/> faith, though it hath the company of other vertues, yet it alone worketh, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on Chriſt, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinne and life eternall: euen as when wee ſay, the eye alone ſeeth, wee doe not meane that the eye is alone in the head, without the company of other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but that the eye though ioyned with hearing, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp;c. yet it alone doth ſee, no other ſenſe concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to help it in that, which is the proper effect of it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>In generall (before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the particular explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this anſwer) you muſt know, that a true iuſtifying faith, ſo farre foorth as it iuſtifieth, is here deſcribed. True faith is commonly called iuſtifying faith, not that this is the full effect of it, beyond which the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of it doth not extend, but becauſe this is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thing, in which the force of true faith is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, as our ſoules are called reaſonable, not becauſe they haue no other operation, then what is reaſonable in ſimple apprehenſion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For our ſenſitiue and naturall actions proceed effectiuely from our ſoules: but becauſe this is the moſt principall work of the ſoule,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17817:100"/> therefore it taketh true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from it, and is termed reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Foure things are now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be vnfolded, 1. what is meante by aſſurance. 2. How a true iuſtifying faith may bee ſaid an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when true Beleeuers are many times doubtfull. 3. The matter about which iuſtifying faith, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it, are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. <hi>viz.</hi> forgiueneſſe of ſinne and life, in the death and obedience of Chriſt, or about Chriſts death &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, as they are a ground of forgiueneſſe of ſinne for mee, and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. 4. The particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, aſſurance that my ſinne is forgiuen, and life obtained for me.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:17817:100"/>1. For the firſt, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance here is meant an aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or confident perſwaſion, which is not onely, when the vnderſtanding determines that truth is ſpoken, but when the will doth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſt vpon that good which is promiſed, which as it is in degree greater or leſſer, ſo is doubting more or leſſe excluded; This is true beliefe<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 8.37</note> of the whole heart. Looke as if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe mee any great good matter, ſay it be but to lend mee an hundreth pounds, when my occaſions require it, I haue not onely a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in vnderſtanding, that the thing you ſpeake to me, you ſpeake it truly; but becauſe here is in the word, that which is good to mee,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17817:101"/> as well as that which is true, therfore I haue a confidence in my will, which maketh me reſt on, and truſt to that you haue ſpoken. If the word ſpoken were true, but not a word any waies bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to me, I might haue an aſſured perſwaſion in minde without any affection or mouing of will toward it: but when it is as well good to mee as true in it ſelfe, it cannot be fully receiued by a mentall perſwaſion aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the truth of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a godly affection imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, as it is a word of good tidings to mee who heare it. Thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſwaſion <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.22. Iob. 19.25 27.</note> and <hi>Iobs</hi> in the 19. of his booke, are to be vnfolded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſecond, wee
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17817:101"/> muſt know, that faith is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies an aſſured perſwaſion, in regard of the euent and thing beleeued, not in regard of the ſenſe and feeling of him who beleeueth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his heart be ſtedfaſt in faith, or trembling through much vnbeleefe, yet beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though with much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe) he ſhall be ſure of the thing promiſed. For it is not the manner of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, but the thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, for which God doth paſſe his promiſe. Now looke as a trembling palſie hand may take the ſame thing, which a more ſteddie one doth, take, though the manner be diuers, the one taketh it ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other without any trembling: ſo a hart of faith,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17817:102"/> which yet ſhaketh &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through much vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, may take Chriſt, as well as a heart doth which is more fully perſwaded, and therfore ſhall haue the grace promiſed for his ſake, who is receiued by faith. God then promiſing to euery true (though weak) beleefe; hence it commeth that faith is a certaine perſwaſion, in regard of the thing beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; certainely bringing vs to receiue the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For euery houſe is as ſure as the foundation is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing hanging on a pin or pegge as ſure as the pegge on which it hangeth. A true faith being a truſt to Gods faithfull promiſe, it cannot miſcary in the euent; for this on which it is grounded is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17817:102"/> vnchangeable.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, though in the euent, it promiſeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſwaſion: yet is it not ſo alwaies in the ſenſe of the beleeuer. It is one thing to haue a thing ſurely; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to know, I haue it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rely. Wee haue many things, which we thinke we haue loſt: ſo a Beleeuer, who hath a ſure beleefe, yet doth not know that he ſo beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nay thinketh that hee is without faith, when he hath it vnfainedly. This falleth out ſometimes in the firſt beginning and conception as it were of faith, ſomtimes afterward. Looke as child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren liue in the wombe, and know not themſelues that they doe liue: ſo is it with many true beleeuing ſoules,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17817:103"/> who long beleeue, before they come to ſee themſelues to beleeue, and be able by a reflexed operation of minde to ſay,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>I know on whom I haue beleeued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Say that now they are come to know, they haue faith: and that God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them in Chriſt, yet may this their ſenſe be ſoon altered, partly through a childiſh weakneſſe of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, partly through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temptations. For as children, though they now to their feeling) are well: yet if they come to ſee their owne bloud, or to be left all alone in the darke, beginne to conceiue twentie ſtrange matters: ſo Gods children who now thinke themſelues well, while they are in the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17817:103"/> light, and feele his gracious preſence, if this bee a little hidden, or if they finde not their accuſtomed life, and cheerefulneſſe in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, they beginne to thinke all is turned with them, and call all into queſtion.</p>
               <p>Againe, looke as the wiſeſt man, may come to haue the eye of reaſon ſo depraued through diſtemper of braine, that he ſhall think his friends ſeeke to kill him, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his foes; yea the eye of his body ſo depraued by a ſtroake, or by ouer-flowing of choller, that he ſhall think all things before him red and yellow, though they be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo; euen ſo by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtroake of ſome waſting ſinne, or the ſtrange worke of ſome more ſharpe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

               <p>The third thing to bee marked, is that, about which faith is conuerſant, which is Chriſt obeying to death, that he may finde righteouſneſſe and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to life in him.

How this new Creature is begotten. 2. In what it ſtandeth. 3. In what order it is brought foorth. 4. The workes whereby it is diſcerned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In generation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren there are Parents and a ſeede of each Parent, and a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17817:140"/> force making the ſeed fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

For if the old man be mortified in the new Creature, then will ſuch workes be refrained, which he liued in, while hee was in this ſtate of corruption: for looke as men dead to this naturall life, ceaſe quite from the workes of it: ſo the new man being dead to ſinne, liues not in it, when we liued in ſinne, we were<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 6.20.22.</note> free from righteouſneſſe, we quite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from it: ſo when we are ſet free from ſinne, and made ſeruants to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we can no more obey

               <p>Secondly obſerue, that our faith and loue, are both imperfect, and ſo all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation imperfect; the fruit cannot haue that, which the tree hath not in it to giue. If our inherent graces which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17817:152"/> are the tree, be imperfect, the fruite muſt needs bee ſo alſo.<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.2.</note> Wee know nothing as we ſhould, of thoſe things which we know, and many things wee are ignorant in, which we ſhould know. We are like the blinde man<note n="e" place="margin">Mar. 8.24</note>, whoſe eyes now opened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſee men like trees: Looke as children know not at all many things, they come to know afterward, ſo we; and looke as they doe not know fully thoſe things, which they know but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially: ſo is it with vs in heauenly matters. Hence our confidence cannot bee perfect. Thoſe who know God beſt, truſt him beſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then it is with men.<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 9.10</note> Thoſe who know thee, will truſt in thee; thoſe who
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17817:152"/> dimly know him, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth, they can but weakely beleeue on him. Neither doth it hinder this truth, that ſometime ſimple men, who can anſwere you little of God, are ſo ſtrong in faith, that they ſuffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, when Schoole Doctors turne tippet; for as theſe haue a more excellent confidence in God, ſo they haue a more worthy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then the greateſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, for they doe in cleare light, ſee God to bee vnto them, a mercifull, faithfull, and all-ſufficient God, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeaſon, which the other haue not, though in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue knowledge, they farre out-ſtrippe them. Hence likewiſe, loue muſt needes be imperfect; for the appetite,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17817:153"/> as it cannot mooue to that it knoweth not at all; ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moue further for degree then it doth know the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of goodneſſe, in the thing it moueth to; Now vvhen vve knovv not hovv abſolute for degree, theſe good things are, vve cannot loue them in perfection.</p>
               <p>Againe, loue follovveth not only the thing knowne, but the euidence of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; hence it is that if I know a thing by heare-ſay, I cannot pitty it ſo, as if I did ſee it: ſo the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth not ſo affect being reported, as if our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it; for the knowledge of the eye, is more euident then of the eare.</p>
               <p>So becauſe our knowledge, is an ineuident knowledg, by
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17817:153"/> heare-ſay of beleefe: hence it is that wee cannot ſo loue God, as if we did ſee him as he is; knowledge, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, loue being imperfect, all our operation is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: if the member where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I moue be lame, needes muſt my pace bee halting likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs then labour to ſee our wants, in theſe regards. If our bodily eye did ſee but dimmely, we would doe twentie things to helpe it.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17817:171"/> was it from heauen or men? it was not from men, but God. None can make a ſigne, or paſſe by ſeale that which is not in his power to beſtow; Now grace, both of illumination and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not in the power of any Creature, and therefore hee cannot inſtitute ſignes, which ſhall ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of theſe things, which are aboue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe; and as none but Kings can appoint a ſeale of eſtate, which ſhall ſigne in the Common-wealth: ſo none in the Church, but Chriſt himſelfe the Lord and King, can appoint a ſeale, which ſhall ſignifie ought in the Church.

                  </gap>oorth in the Creation, and ſo things naturall ſhould haue a force, communicated to them, of teaching ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, or elſe by Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtitution: ſuch we read not any, but of Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper onely; Or by the Churches impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. But this cannot be: for Prayer obteineth thoſe effects of things, to which they ſerue, by Gods Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inſtitution: but not
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17817:172"/> any creating or new concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, to ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vſes. For then the Church might aske, that this or that Creature, ſhould be made a Sacrament vnto her. But ſhe ſhould pray without all warrant of Gods will in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt Circumſtance is the end, which is our further aſſurance, touching Chriſt with his benefits beſtowed on vs. Where conſider firſt the ſecuritie they giue vs. Secondly, the things they ſecure to vs, Though Gods word be true, and cannot be made more true in it ſelfe: yet it may bee made more credible to mee. For there are two things which make a thing ſpoken, more credible. 1. The qualitie of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17817:172"/> ſpeaking. 2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking or affirming any thing. God who is truth nakedly ſpeaking any thing, it is preſently credible to my beleefe: but if God doe not ſimply ſpeake, but ſolemnly ſweare: yea not ſweare a thing, but ſet a ſeale; the ſame thing, though it cannot bee more true: yet it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more credible. For looke as when a ſure man promiſeth vs any thing, wee doe beleeue it: yet if hee ſweare it, giue vs his hand and ſeale for it, it doth much increaſe our confidence: ſo it is here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the thing it doth ſecure vs, is Chriſt, his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh 4.10</note> that gift of God. As within the outward ſhell of a nutte or ſuch like, which we
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17817:173"/> ſee, there is a kernell, which wee cannot ſee; ſo theſe ſignes haue vnder them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible graces. Looke as the ſeales of men are nor ſet to blankes, but to teſtamentary euidences, wherein inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, legacies, lands, &amp;c. are conueied: ſo Gods ſeales are ſet to his teſtament, to confirme all that which Chriſt the Teſtator hath giuen vnto vs; Now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his benefits, are that which he leaueth vs: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then theſe are pictures and ſeales, euen aſſuring Chriſt himſelfe to vs: how ſhould we delight to bee in the view of theſe, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the receiuing of them.</p>
               <p>Louing wiues are deſirous often, when their Huſbands
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17817:173"/> trauell to haue the pictures of them. When great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe beginne to make loue to ſome great Princeſſe in another land, they ſend them their picture. Thus Chriſt our Husband now abſent in heauen, and making loue to vs in earth, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vs theſe Sacraments, as his pictures, which looking on by the eye of Faith, wee may ſee him. Againe had we but any confirmation of Land, to be paſſed by ſeale, how would we waite on the houre appointed to ſuch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines? how much more here, where Chriſt and all good things in Chriſt, are aſſured to vs?</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs reſt in the vſe of theſe ſeales God hath appointed. For all ſignes of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:17817:174"/> mens deuiſing, cannot teach or helpe deuotion, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, and breed ſuperſtition. Beſide, to doe any thing which doth derogate from the ſeale of Kings, &amp; their prerogatiue therein, wee know how dangerous it is, in Common-wealth: ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, to joyne ſeales with Gods ſeales in his Church, is a point will hardly bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>

               <p>Prayer is a large word, comprehending all that ſpeech, which the faithfull ſoule hath with God, in way of Petition or thankſgiuing; for to theſe 2. branches, the Confeſſion of ſinne, which we make in Prayer may bee reduced; the end whereof is, that ſometime by laying open our miſery, wee may moue God to mercy, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine otherwhile we may by

Wherefore let vs come to God, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of merit, whereby wee may in iuſtice claime any thing from him. For if I thinke a thing due to me, and my owne by right, I cannot begge it vnfainedly, as I would doe a thing which is not mine, further then the bountie of him I intreate, ſhall beſtow it on me.

               <p>Againe, when Praier doth not ſimply aske things, but aske them as meanes making for Gods glory and our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and when no power but God can make Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things conduce to the glory of his name and the increaſe of grace in vs: hence it is manifeſt, we cannot aske any thing religiouſly, but of God onely; Euen as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man cannot deſire any thing according to nature which doth not pertaine, to

               <p>Obſerue thirdly, We muſt ſeeke things lawfull to Gods glory. To the firſt, I ſpeake ſomething in the laſt anſwer. Looke as wee would not come to any man, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which would tend to his reproach if hee ſhould yeeld it to vs: ſo wee muſt not come to God with any Requeſts, the performance whereof may not bee to his glory. Honour with men is the ſpurre of all their actions, a man of honour will not do that, which ſhall redound to his diſcredit, or not be at all to his credit: much leſſe will God grant vs, and effect for vs, thoſe things which are not for his glory.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:17817:201"/>4. We muſt come<note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 1.6.</note> with Faith, not doubting<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 4.16</note>. Let vs enter with confidence, hope well and euer haue wel. For looke as men count it great treachery, not to bee true and do their vtmoſt, for thoſe that truſt to them: ſo God failes not a beleeuing heart. Beſide the ſuite will be cold there, where there is no confidence to ſpeede.</p>
               <p n="5">5. With feeling. Hungring deſire after, yea care and thought, about the thing we ſeeke: deſire of a thing with out word vttered to GOD with minde or voice is no Prayer: ſpeech to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward deſire, is but a ſhadow without ſubſtance. If we finde men aske for fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhion, not much caring for the thing they intreat, wee
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17817:201"/> anſwere them accordingly: ſo doth God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, wee muſt haue loue to God, reciprocall loue in Perſons maketh ſuits ſucceſſefull. Looke as men readily yeeld requeſt to ſuch as they know are their louing friends: ſo God if he ſee we loue him, and are friends of his, as he<note n="g" place="margin">Eſa. 41.8</note> called <hi>Abraham,</hi> he will not refuſe vs in any thing good for vs. 2. Again loue to our brethren and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeruants. If one haue ſuite to ſome great Perſon, it is no ſmall furtherance, to haue the loue of the people that are about him, of the ſeruants in family that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by him: ſo it is with vs, to bee in louing league with all the Lords ſeruants, is no ſmall aduantage to vs.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:17817:202"/> 3. In loue of the things wee pray for, otherwiſe if wee haue no loue to them, we ſhould but vſe words for forme ſake, and bee indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men without all feeling, and more neere touch of the things deſired.</p>
               <p>Let vs then thus come to God through Chriſt, whoſe mediation will make our Prayers as a ſweete incenſe pleaſing to God. Let vs haue care what wee aske, and to ſtirre vp our faith in asking, by ſetting the promiſes of God, his Commandements the gracious nature of God, the goodneſſe of the things wee ſeeke before our eyes. For the more we know him, the better we ſhall truſt him. and the more wee truſt him, the more he will worke for
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:17817:202"/> vs. Let vs feelingly come to him, ſetting an edge on our deſires, wee muſt conſider our wants, the diſcomforts attending on them, comforts kept from vs, how happy we ſhould be, were they ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the things we want. Thus will our Prayers bee like keene-headed arrowes, which will pierce heauen through the feeling feruency that is in them. Finally, let vs get loue. With what heart can we come to God, if wee are not in louing league with him and his? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thus wee ſhall be heard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or indirectly: as a Phyſician doth not heare his Patient in that he would, yet heareth him in taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doe another thing, more conducible to his

Theſe precepts do inioine it, as a thing which wanteth not his force for our good. Look as thoſe who can read their Fathers wills, Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other writings, haue a great aduantage to know them ouer an other hath, who cannot read at all: ſo it is no ſmal furtherance, when wee can read this Will and Teſtament, which Chriſt hath left vs. Beſides, looke as men muſt get prouiſion of meate and drinke, before they can put it into mouth, chew it and digeſt it: ſo the ſoule muſt by reading fetch
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:17817:204"/> in as it were, a new prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heauenly food, before we can haue what to thinke on, what to chew by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, what to direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our care by in practiſe and conuerſation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of this.

We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read ſay ſome: Lament it in your ſelues, do for your ſoules as in earthly things. If
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17817:204"/> there be a clauſe in thy leaſe, or in any matter concerning thee, which thou cauſt not read, thou wilt get it copied, forth, and deſire others that can, to read it to thee: ſo thou ſhouldſt get thee a new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, &amp; intreat others to read before thee, that ſo thou maiſt ſupply this defect.</p>
               <p>Obſerue ſecondly, priuate Prayer is an exerciſe, much helping vs forward, whether we do it apart from others, or with others, whether more ſolemnely vſing formes of words before God, or by eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation only. Praier priuate in any of theſe kinds much auaileth. If one who talketh with a good man, is much the better for it, how much ſhall the ſoule bee bettered, which doth accuſtome it ſelfe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17817:205"/> to talke with God from day to day. For when Chriſt will haue vs pray daily for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, how much more is it the will of God, that wee ſhould pray from day to day, &amp; ſeeke his grace in regard of things ſpirituall. Looke as it is with earthly Subiects, they who ſee the King and haue libertie of ſpeech with him only, when he doth ſhew himſelfe a broad to his people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they get nothing ſo much, as thoſe who are daily about the King, who poſſeſſe his eare, and are ſtill ſolliciting their further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements: thus in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, he who hath pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate acceſſe to God, &amp; hath liberty to ſollicite him with new Petitions from time to

               <p>We muſt not then think it is enough to pray at Church as if Gods publike ſeruice did juſtle foorth his priuate:<label type="milestone">
